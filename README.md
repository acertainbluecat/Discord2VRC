# Discord2VRC

A simple Discord bot and a web server that allows you to load images that have been uploaded to select discord channels into VRChat worlds directly. 
As this was primarily a project I started for personal use, the way it has been set up is mainly catered to what was convenient for me, which may not neccessarily be the case for others. I may not have used the best practices for the sake of convenience, so keep that in mind if you are interested in using this. This is only for SDK2 worlds for now until Udon receives support for loading remote images.

# Web server 

API Documentation: https://discord2vrc.nyanpa.su/docs
Feel free to play around with the sample web app I have set up above to see how the web end points work. 
There are 2 channel "aliases" set up "vrchat" and "ffxiv".

Of note, the randomsync endpoints will return a random image using the current server time based on intervals.
That means reloading the image in vrchat should show the same random image to everyone in the instance as long as they load it at the same time for the most part.

# SDK2

The provided unitypackage for sdk2 uses vrc_panorama to load remote images. In it are 2 sample prefabs that are currently set to load sample endpoints I have set up for demonstration purposes that loads the latest image and a randomly selected pseudo sync'd image that can be dynamically reloaded at runtime. Replace the URLs with your own.
